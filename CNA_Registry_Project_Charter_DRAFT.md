# Project Charter

## Project Name:  CNA Registry Requirements Elicitation

## Project Lead:  TBD

## Overview:
The CNA Registry requirements elicitation project is a collaborative effort to gather, analyze, and document the user stories and 
requirements for a searchable CNA registry. The proposed registry would contain information needed to support key CVE workflows,
enable automation, and enhance coordination between CNAs.

## Objectives:
- Provide unique identifiers for CNAs
- Create, assign, register, and manage CNA namespaces
- Store information about each CNA that the CNA itself would maintain such as: 
  - GitHub users authorized to submit pull requests
  - CNA scope designations
  - Official names for organizations/products as declared by vendor
  - Public keys
  - Points-of-contacts
- Establish rules governing changes to stored CVE data provided by the CNA
- Provide underlying components for authentication and authorization.

## Proposed Activities:
- Document workflows
- Develop user stories that describe the:
 - Capabilities to be provided by the service
 - Resources required and dependencies that exist
 - Assumptions/Constraints
 - Acceptance criteria
- Document the business, user, functional, security and performance requirements for the proposed capabilities.
